excerpt: "Why did I decide to start a Blog? What will I write about?"

Hi! I decided to start a Blog because as a Software Developer Engineer mostly focused on front end technologies I found myself searching for some tricky implementations over and over again, also as a study method in JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and tools. It is well known that _If you can explain how something works you reinforce your knowledge_.

Before going further, I would like to mention that I am not a native English speaker so if you find errors in my writing feedback is welcome(I will appreciate it). I write in English in order to reach more people.

WhateverJS is for me a Blog where to write about JavaScript technologies I test and maybe some tutorials, lessons or recipes, as well as the language itself.
